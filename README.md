# Common Email Flow

## View this project [here!](https://dzeignyc.github.io/common-email-flow/)

### All emails were coded using Mailchimp

### `Prompt 1`
You find out that 50% of people who schedule a tour with us either cancel or don’t show up at the promised date. Devise an email flow consisting of 2 - 3 emails; the objective is to encourage the leads to schedule another tour and ensure they show up. Please be sure to articulate ways in which you would segment this particular group of leads and make this email flow more targeted.

Data that we have on our users include the following:
- Name, Email, and Phone Number
- Budget
- Move-in Date
- City of Interest
- Home/Apartment of Interest
- Cancelled Tour Date
- Cancellation Reason

Your emails should include details on the following:
- How/When is it triggered?
- How will your lists be segmented?
- What messaging will ensure that the leads feel the email is personalized for them?

## How/When is it triggered?
For users that cancelled:
- The first email is triggered immediately after cancellation.
- The second email is triggered if the user doesn’t schedule a tour within 48 hours.
- The third email is triggered if the user doesn’t schedule a tour within the next 24 hours.

For users that missed the promise date:
- The first email is triggered 24 hours after their missed promise date.
- The second email is triggered if the user doesn’t schedule a tour within 48 hours.
- The third email is triggered if the user doesn’t schedule a tour within the next 24 hours.

## What messaging will ensure that the leads feel the email is personalized for them?
The email flow (messages) will ensure that the leads feel the email is personalized for them by utilizing the following information:
- Their name in the Subject line AND/OR introduction/body of the email
- Their cancellation or missed promise date.
- Their city/home of interest (through text AND/OR images)
- Their move-in date
- Name of their tour guide

## How will your lists be segmented?
`We’ll segment the 50% of users that either cancel or don’t show up by placing them into their respective segmented groups:
Cancelled Users
Ghosted Users`

We’ll go forward with the two groups above for now, but if we were to take this a step further we can segment in the following ways:
- Cancelled Users (Based on City of Interest)
- Ghosted Users (Based on City of Interest)

- Cancelled Users (Based on Home/Apartment of Interest)
- Ghosted Users (Based on Home/Apartment of Interest)

- Cancelled Users (Based on Move-in Date)
- Ghosted Users (Based on Move-in Date)

- Cancelled Users (Based on Budget)
- Ghosted Users (Based on Budget)

We can also segment based on the multiple data points listed above.
`Ex: Cancelled Users (Based on City of Interest AND/OR Budget AND/OR Move-in Date)
So on and so forth.`
